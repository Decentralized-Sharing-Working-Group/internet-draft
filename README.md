# Motivation

This draft proposes to structure and list what is a decentralized sharing 
between persons from server-to-server by identifying the steps and the
associated challenges.

There is no consensus yet on how to share documents privately over the
internet, in such a way that recipient(s) are notified, but other people
cannot retrieve the document, nor discover its existence.

This draft does not propose one universal solution, but rather lists
what puzzle pieces we are aware of, and what options may exist to put
them together.
We expect this document could be used as a guideline for an interoperable
sharing between decentralized platforms.
